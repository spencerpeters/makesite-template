<p>
  Hi, I'm Spencer. I'm a fifth-year CS PhD candidate at Cornell University.
</p>

  <p>
    My current research interests are in theoretical cryptography, particularly lattice-based cryptography and lattice algorithms, but in the past I've also worked on learning theory and causality projects. I'm extremely fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://www.noahsd.com">Noah Stephens-Davidowitz</a>.
  </p>

  <p> Outside of research, I play ultimate frisbee for Cornell, and I'm playing the long game with progressive bodyweight training and meditation. I also enjoy swing dancing and basketball.
    <!-- As of now (summer 2023) I'm headed to Boston for a summer of work in
         <a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/vinodv/">Vinod Vaikuntanathan</a>'s research group at MIT. -->
    <!-- As of now (May 2022) I'm heading to Berkeley for
         <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/programs/extended-reunion-lattices2022">
         Lattices and Beyond!
         </a> -->
  </p>

  <p>
    In past lives, I studied computer science and physics at the University of Washington, and had several eye-opening internships: two with Microsoft's Quantum Architectures and Computing group, and a summer at Jane Street Capital.
